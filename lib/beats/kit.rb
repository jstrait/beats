    # label - The name of the sound to get sample data for. If the sound was defined in
    #         the Kit section of a song file, this will generally be a descriptive label
    #         such as "bass" or "snare". If defined in a track but not the kit, it will
    #         generally be a file name such as "my_sounds/hihat/hi_hat.wav".

    #   # If @num_channels is 2, a Array of Integers pairs:
    #   get_sample_data("snare")
    #   # => [[57, 1265], [-452, 10543], [-2531, 12643], [-6372, 11653], ..., [5482, 25673]]
