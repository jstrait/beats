class InvalidSoundFormatError < RuntimeError; end


# This class provides a repository for the sounds used in a song. Most usefully, it
# also handles converting the sounds to a common format. For example, if a song requires
# a sound that is mono/8-bit, another that is stereo/8-bit, and another that is
# stereo/16-bit, they have to be converted to a common format before they can be used
# together. Kit handles this conversion; all sounds retrieved using
# get_sample_data() will be in a common format.
#
# Sounds can only be added at initialization. During initialization, the sample data
# for each sound is loaded into memory, and converted to the common format if necessary.
# This format is:
#
#   Bits per sample: 16
#   Sample rate:     44100
#   Channels:        Stereo, unless all of the kit sounds are mono.
#
# For example if the kit has these sounds:
#
#   my_sound_1.wav:  mono, 16-bit
#   my_sound_2.wav:  stereo, 8-bit
#   my_sound_3.wav:  mono, 8-bit
#
# they will all be converted to stereo/16-bit during initialization.
