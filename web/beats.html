		<h1>BEATS</h1>
		<p>is a drum machine written in pure Ruby. Feed it a song notated in YAML, and it will produce a precision-milled Wave file of impeccable timing and feel. Here is an example song:</p>
		<p><pre><code>Song:
  Tempo: 120
  Structure:
    - Verse:   x2
    - Chorus:  x4
    - Verse:   x2
    - Chorus:  x4

Verse:
  - bass.wav:       X...X...X...X...
  - snare.wav:      ..............X.
  - hh_closed.wav:  X.XXX.XXX.X.X.X.
  - agogo_high.wav: ..............XX

Chorus:
  - bass.wav:       X...X...X...X...
  - snare.wav:      ....X.......X...
  - hh_closed.wav:  X.XXX.XXX.XX..X.
  - tom4.wav:       ...........X....
  - tom2.wav:       ..............X.</pre></code></p>
		<p class="last">And <a href="beat.mp3">here is what it sounds like</a> after getting the BEATS treatment. What a glorious groove!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="content-box">
		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<p>Run the following command to install BEATS:</p>
		<p><code><pre class="single-line">sudo gem install beats</pre></code></p>
		<p>This will add a <code>beats</code> command to your path.</p>
		<p>BEATS is not terribly useful unless you have drum sounds to use with it. As a public service, here are 20 <span style="text-decoration: line-through">high-quality</span> drum sounds sampled from a <a href="http://images.gittigidiyor.com/1882/Casio-SA-20-Tone-Bank-Elektronik-Klavye__18821134_0.jpg">Casio SA-20 keyboard</a> that the author got when he was 8 years old. Free of charge:</p>
		<p><a href="casio_sa20_drum_sounds.zip">casio_sa20_drum_sounds.zip</a></p>
		<p>The BEATS source code is <a href="http://github.com/jstrait/beats">hosted at GitHub</a>.</p>

		<h2>How to Run</h2>
		<p>BEATS runs from the command-line. The syntax:</p>
		<p><code><pre class="single-line">beats [options] INPUT [OUTPUT]</pre></code></p>
		<p><code>INPUT</code> is the YAML file for your song. <code>OUTPUT</code> is the <code>*.wav</code> file where BEATS will place the generated sound. If omitted, it will default to <code>INPUT</code> but with a <code>.wav</code> extension. (For example, the sound for <code>my_song.txt</code> would be saved to <code>my_song.wav</code>).</p>
		<p>BEATS supports two command-line options, which can be used together or separately:</p>
		<p><code><pre>-s, --split
    Save each track to a separate Wave file,
    instead of combining them into one.


-p, --pattern PATTERN_NAME
    Only generate the pattern PATTERN_NAME,
    instead of the entire song.</pre></code></p>
	<p>Finally, a note about Ruby 1.8 vs. 1.9. BEATS runs on both versions, but is more than 2x faster on 1.9. Therefore, it&#8217;s highly recommended that you use 1.9 if possible. BEATS will run using whichever <code>ruby</code> command <code>/usr/bin/env</code> points to.</p>

		<h2>Creating Songs</h2>
		<p>Songs are notated using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>, so each song file is just a plain text file you can edit in TextEdit, NotePad, or whatever. The file extension doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
		<p>Each song is divided into one or more patterns. A pattern represents a section of the song, such as a verse, chorus, or bridge. Each pattern in turn has one or more tracks. Each track represents an individual sound, such as a bass drum, snare, or hi-hat.</p>
		<p>Songs should start with a header indicating the tempo, and the structure of the song. Should the verse be played four times followed by the chorus two times then a bridge? YOU decide.</p>
		<p>Here&#8217;s an example header. Since this is YAML, lines must be indented correctly. Also, each pattern in the structure should be preceded by a dash.</p>
		<p><pre><code>Song:
  Tempo: 120
  Structure:
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2
    - Bridge:  x1
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2</code></pre></p>
		<p>One or more patterns should follow the header. (If there are no patterns, there is nothing to play!) Each pattern definition starts with the pattern name, followed by the rhythm for each track on separate lines.</p>
		<p><pre><code>Verse:
  - bass.wav:      X.......X.......
  - snare.wav:     ....X.......X...
  - hh_closed.wav: X.X.X.X.X.X.X...
  - hh_open.wav:   ..............X.
  - ride.wav:      X...............</code></pre></p>
		<p>Each track line starts with the sound file to use (only 8 or 16-bit Wave files are supported). You can either use a relative or absolute path; relative paths are relative from the path of the song file. Track lines must be indented properly and start with a dash (once again, due to this being YAML).</p>
		<p>The track rhythm follows the sound name. An <code>X</code> means that the sound should be triggered, and a <code>.</code> indicates a &#8220;rest&#8221; between triggers. Each <code>X</code> or <code>.</code> represents a 16th note. You only need to indicate the downbeat of each sound, since sounds will play their full duration (unless cut off by another trigger). For example, to play a quarter note rhythm, <code>X...X...X...X...</code> will do the trick.</p>
		<p>As a final note, patterns and the song header can come in any order. If you want to put the song header at the end of the file, you can. You can also mix up the order that patterns are defined.</p>
