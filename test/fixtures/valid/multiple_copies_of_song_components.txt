# This example includes multiple copies of song components such as the Flow, Kit, etc.
# In general, multiple copies of the same song component are allowed (due to the Song
# header being a YAML hash), but the final definition should be chosen as the winner.


# This song header is ignored, because it is overridden by a subsequent song
# header at the end of the file
