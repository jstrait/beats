# Test fixture to verify SongOptimizer bug fix.
#
# SongOptimizer.subdivide_song_patterns() breaks up patterns into smaller sub-patterns. The bug
# was that when master patterns had numeric suffixes, new sub-patterns could be given names that
# collided with other sub-patterns. If they had different rhythms, one sub-pattern would obliterate
# the other one leading to incorrect song output.
#
# In the example below, when sub-dividing patterns with a max size of 4 steps, the new patterns
# highlighted with !!!! would both be called Verse20, causing a collision.
